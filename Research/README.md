# The Environmental Impact of AI

## **Abstract**  
The rapid advancement of artificial intelligence has brought transformative changes across industries, but its environmental impact is an increasingly pressing concern. This paper explores the substantial energy consumption associated with AI, particularly in training large language models, and highlights the often-overlooked water usage required to cool data centers. It examines DeepSeek, a Chinese AI company focused on developing cost-efficient and less energy-intensive models, while also raising questions about data privacy. Additionally, the paper discusses how AI’s growing energy demands threaten the corporate climate commitments of major tech companies, with nuclear power emerging as a potential solution. AI's role in advertising is also explored, showcasing efficiency gains through automation and energy-conscious hardware solutions like Google’s TPUs. Finally, the paper considers AI’s potential to contribute to environmental conservation and other societal benefits, emphasizing the importance of responsible AI implementation to balance its advantages with its ecological footprint.
