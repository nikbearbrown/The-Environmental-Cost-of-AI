At the heart of AI’s advertising prowess lies its capacity to decode complex consumer behaviors and preferences. IPG Interact harnesses Acxiom’s first-party data, which spans 2.5 billion consumer profiles, to build granular audience segments based on factors such as purchase history, brand affinities, and online activity[^10][^11]. This dataset, combined with Real ID’s cross-device tracking capabilities, enables the platform to map customer journeys across digital and physical touchpoints, ensuring ads reach individuals at optimal moments in their decision-making process[^1][^2]. For instance, a retail brand using Interact could target users who abandoned online shopping carts with dynamic retargeting ads, supplemented by AI-generated discounts to incentivize completion[^6][^13].

AI’s targeting precision is further enhanced by techniques like natural language processing (NLP) and computer vision, which analyze unstructured data from social media posts, product reviews, and visual content[^9]. Booking.com utilized similar tools to personalize on-site recommendations, resulting in a 73.72% increase in conversion rates and a 16.15% rise in average order value[^9]. These advancements are not limited to digital channels; IPG’s integration of offline sales data into Interact allows brands to measure the offline impact of digital campaigns, closing the loop between ad exposure and in-store purchases[^10][^11]. By unifying disparate data sources under a single AI-driven framework, Interact delivers a 360-degree view of consumer behavior, empowering marketers to craft campaigns that align with both immediate and long-term business objectives[^2][^13].
